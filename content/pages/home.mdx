## Hi Founders, I'm Jacky 👋

Only founders know founders. I love working directly with founders to tackle challenges and seize opportunities, making the journey as exciting as the destination. Let's grow and solve problems together.

## My Story 🌟

Ten years ago, I began my entrepreneurial journey straight out of college, launching my first startup from my dorm room. It wasn’t easy, but the experience taught me invaluable lessons about resilience, innovation, and the importance of community. Now, I’m passionate about sharing these lessons and supporting other founders on their paths to success.
